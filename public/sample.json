  "description": "Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there. After a dust storm nearly kills him &amp; forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded &amp; completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he&rsquo;s alive&mdash;&amp; even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment or plain-old &quot;human error&quot; are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills&mdash;&amp; a relentless, dogged refusal to quit&mdash;he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?"
